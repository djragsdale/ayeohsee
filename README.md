zero-dependency dependency injection dependency

## Summary

Don't over-engineer your solution. This package is usable, however it is an example of simple engineering. Dependency Injection and Front End Frameworks aren't usually needed. If injection is barely needed, use closures. Only if those do not meet your needs should you use one of the included techniques. If you are architecting a 100,000 file application, use a framework. The point of this library is to illustrate how much you can accomplish with 0 tooling and no frameworks.

## Usage

Use deep imports to only get the code you need.

## Desired Features

- Each container type fully tested
- Each container type has a full browser script for legacy browsers
- Each container type has a full browser module (ESM)
- Each container type has a full CJS module
- No dependencies ever
